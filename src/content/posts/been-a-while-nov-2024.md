Wow. A lot of time has passed since I last wrote anything here, and a lot has
happened: I’ve had two new jobs, I moved to Sweden, I’ve spent a lot of time
with [Go](https://go.dev), and I had another baby.

Life has been busy and I haven’t found much time to think, let alone write any
new posts. It’s a challenge to find a good balance between work, family, fun,
and writing down thoughts. I’m hoping I’ve found enough balance, for the moment,
to write at least a few new posts.

It will be nice to put some more thoughts out into the world. Hopefully, someone
will find these things useful.
